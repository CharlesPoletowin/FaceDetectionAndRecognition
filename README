This is a project for detecting face or recognizing faces

faceDetect.ipynb is a file using dlib which is a python library, and this file runs on Google Colab

***

OpenCV is a directory containing modeling downloading from the official website of OpenCV,
so faceDetect.py is a file using OpenCV;premodel is a directory containing models downloading from the website
testdata is a directory containing few data which we could use, and these pictures are downloading from Columbia University
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/pubfig/download/

***

faceDetectUsingBaiduAPI.py is a file using Baidu official API, it could help us detect face easily.

add a file face_recognition.ipynb which is a file using face_recognition library based on dlib,
and this is an example to identify whether two people in the picture is the same people

***

add files of a test of SSR_NET using the model optimized for Asian
using the command like "python SSRNET_test.py data/test/*.mp4 OR gif '3'" in the directory SSR_NET_Test

age_gender_estimation is a a Keras implementation of a CNN for estimating age and gender from a face image [1, 2]. In training, the IMDB-WIKI dataset is used.
The pretrained model for TensorFlow backend will be automatically downloaded to the pretrained_models directory.
Just using the command like "python age_gender_estimation.py --image_dir data/" it can run to test for the demos in the directory data which must exist
And now the result will save in the "result.csv"

add FaceRank using pretrained model from face_rank_model.h5
just run predict.py so it will automatically create a result.csv file to save the results, the test pictures are in the file data

Add Image Correction directory
It can revise the italic photos especially those with identity cards, and it can catch the faces and save it in the result directory.

Adjust the size of files which will input in imgcorr.py, so it could accelerate computing speed for the large files.
Delete those useless data

 Schroff F , Kalenichenko D , Philbin J . [IEEE 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) - Boston, MA, USA (2015.6.7-2015.6.12)] 2015 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) - FaceNet: A unified embedding for face recognition and clustering[J]. 2015:815-823.
 a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering".

 This is a demo for comparing the distances between different people.
 If the distance is below 1.1, we assume they're the same people,otherwise they are different people.
